# Praetorian - Java to Machine Code Compiler

Praetorian is in development to be a Java to machine code compiler. This
project is in its early stages and is not yet ready for use. The goal is to
create a compiler that can take Java source code and compile it to machine
code that can be run on a computer without the need for a Java Virtual Machine.

## Goals:
- [X] Create a lexer
- [X] Create a parser
- [X] Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):
- [ ] Create an intermediate representation
- [ ] Create proper Documentation
- [ ] Add support for most Java versions (JDK11-Current)
- [ ] Make this useable compilable by the command line and a external program

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and
build the project. This project is written in CPP and can compile in a number
of ways. You can download [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) or [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
to compile the project.

⚠️ I will refractor this code sometime before March, so instead of one file, its going to be multiple. ⚠️
