# Praetorian - Java to Machine Code Compiler

Praetorian is in development to be a Java to machine code compiler. This
project is in its early stages and is not yet ready for use. The goal is to
create a compiler that can take Java source code and compile it to machine
code that can be run on a computer without the need for a Java Virtual Machine.

## Goals:
- [X] Create a lexer
- [X] Create a parser
- [ ] Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):
- [ ] Create an intermediate representation
- [ ] Create a code generator
- [ ] Create a runtime library
- [ ] Create a standard library
- [ ] Create proper Documentation
- [ ] Add support for all Java versions
